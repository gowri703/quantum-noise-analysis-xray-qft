## Analysis of Noise Effects in Chest X-ray Images Using Quantum Fourier Transform
### Overview

This project analyzes the impact of Gaussian and Salt-and-Pepper noise on chest X-ray image patches in the frequency domain using:

Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

Classical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

The project demonstrates amplitude encoding of image data into quantum states and compares probabilistic quantum frequency distributions with deterministic classical spectra.
